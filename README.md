# KindSite

**KindSite — Make every site a little kinder**

Universities already provide “accommodations,” but support is fragmented across PDFs, web pages, and videos. KindSite untangles that. Students registered with Accessibility Services set simple preferences once (readability, motion, math, captions). From there, our **chatbot** fixes uploaded PDFs to match those preferences, and our **browser extension** applies the same profile to any live webpage—bigger dyslexia-friendly fonts, calmer spacing, motion off, math that’s read clearly, and one-click captions.

What makes KindSite different is **voice continuity**. Using **ElevenLabs**, instructors can safely clone their teaching voice; then the reader, math, and code all sound like class. *Hearing your own professor read the material—pronouncing every course term the same way—turns every PDF and page into a continuation of class.*

Under the hood: content-aware LaTeX → speech, per-block voice routing (Narration/Code/Math), ElevenLabs STT captions for video, and privacy-first on-device styling. KindSite reduces cognitive load, standardizes pronunciation, and lets Accessibility Offices scale support—without more tickets.
