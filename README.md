## üß© Overview

Universities already provide *accommodations* ‚Äî but the support is fragmented across PDFs, websites, and videos.  
**KindSite** untangles that.

Students registered with Accessibility Services set simple preferences once ‚Äî readability, motion, math, captions ‚Äî and those settings follow them everywhere.

- üß† **Chatbot PDF Fixer** ‚Äî upload a course PDF ‚Üí KindSite reformats it with your accessibility profile.  
- üåê **Browser Extension** ‚Äî automatically applies your preferences to live webpages:
  - Dyslexia-friendly fonts & calm spacing  
  - Reduced motion & visual clutter  
  - Clear, natural math narration  
  - One-click captions for videos

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Continuity

**What makes KindSite unique:** *familiarity.*

Using [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), instructors can safely clone their teaching voice.  
Then:

- Every paragraph, equation, and code block is read in that same voice.  
- Pronunciation stays consistent across classes and materials.  
- Students hear their own professor explain every concept ‚Äî just like lecture.

> Voice continuity bridges digital content and classroom experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

| Layer | Technologies | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, React, Tailwind | Dashboard + extension UI |
| **Backend** | Flask, Supabase | API endpoints, preference storage |
| **Voice Engine** | ElevenLabs TTS + STT | Speech synthesis, live captions |
| **Accessibility Engine** | Custom DOM transformer | Font, motion, color, and layout adjustments |
| **Packaging** | Chrome Extension (MV3) | In-browser real-time adaptation |

## üß† How It Works

1. **Preferences Setup**  
   Students specify font type, size, motion sensitivity, and caption preferences in the KindSite dashboard.

2. **PDF Processing**  
   PDFs uploaded to the chatbot are processed with content-aware rendering:  
   LaTeX ‚Üí semantic speech ‚Üí ElevenLabs voice output.

3. **Live Web Adaptation**  
   The browser extension detects page structure and applies on-device transformations, ensuring privacy and speed.

4. **Voice Continuity**  
   Distinct pipelines for Narration / Math / Code maintain clear context while keeping the same instructor voice.
